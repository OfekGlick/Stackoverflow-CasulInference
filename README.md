### Data extraction
To extract data from Stackoverflow we used the [Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/new) and we based our queries based on the
Stackoverflow [Schema](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2677/database-schema-documentation-for-the-public-data-dump-and-sede).<br>
The queries used for extraction are saved in the `Data Extraction Query.txt` file.
